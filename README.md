Hi guys! Redraskal here wanting to announce that this plugin is no longer going to be developed or released online. A lot of people got upset that I copied Mineplex, but I just wanted to assure you that I didn't intend to upset anyone. I want to make plugins that people love and not hate, so that is why I have taken it down. If you have downloaded it, I want to ask that you delete it because a lot of people got mad about this plugin, and I don't want your server to get lots of hate comments because this plugin is on your server. I hope everyone understands that I am sorry for this, because I am. I do have a Mineplex Pumpkin plugin, but I will take it down if you don't want it. The download link will take you to the github page if you want the source code.

Best Wishes,
Redraskalâ€‹
